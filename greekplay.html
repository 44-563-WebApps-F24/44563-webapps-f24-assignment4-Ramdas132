        <h6>The Seven Plays in English Verse by Sophocles</h6>
        <h6>PR.</h6><p> Lo, in good time, crowning thy gracious word,
            'Tis told me by these youths, Creon draws near.</p>
            
            <h6>OED.</h6> <p>Apollo! may his coming be as blest
            With saving fortune, as his looks are bright.</p>
            
            <h6>PR.</h6><p> Sure he brings joyful news; else had he ne'er
            Worn that full wreath of thickly-berried bay.</p>
            
            <h6>OED.</h6> <p>We have not long to doubt. He can hear now.</p>
            
            <p>_Enter_ CREON.</p>
            
            <p>Son of Menoeceus, brother of my queen,
            What answer from Apollo dost thou bring?</p>
            
            <h6>CREON.</h6> <p>Good; for my message is that even our woes,
            When brought to their right issue, shall be well.</p>
            
            <h6>OED.</h6> <p> What saith the oracle? Thy words so far
            Neither embolden nor dishearten me.</p>
            
            <h6>CR.</h6> <p>Say, must I tell it with these standing by,
            Or go within? I am ready either way.</p>
